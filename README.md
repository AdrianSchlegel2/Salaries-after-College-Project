# Salaries-after-College-Project
In this project I used the **pandas** library to analyze a csv of median pays of students after college depending on the major they graduated with. From there on I found the majors with the highest potential of a high salary, the largest spread between high and low earners, low risk majors as well as the group of majors which has the highest earning mean.
